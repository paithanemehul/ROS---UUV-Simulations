STEPS FOR AN UUV TO AVOID OBSTACLES:

# We will use REXROV as our UUV for the simulation.

To build a functioning underwater vehicle, you will need hardware components such as sensors, motors,
and a controller that interfaces with your computer. Once you have these components in place, you can
use a programming language like Python to control the vehicle.

Here are the steps:

1). Initialize the hardware components and sensors on Rexrov.
2). Define the start and end points for the vehicle's journey.
3). Determine the optimal path from the start to the end point using an appropriate algorithm such as A* or Dijkstra's algorithm.
4). Set the vehicle in motion towards the end point, using the motor controller to adjust speed and direction.
5). Continuously monitor the sensors for obstacles such as rocks, reefs, or other marine life.
6). If an obstacle is detected, calculate a new path around it and adjust the vehicle's course accordingly.
7). Continue navigating until the end point is reached, or until the vehicle runs out of power or encounters a critical error.
